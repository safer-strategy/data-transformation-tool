# Spreadsheet Format - Guidelines

The spreadsheet file consists of multiple tabs. Each tab represents either entity data or the relationship between two entities.

If you don't have data for one or more entities, you can leave the respective tab(s) empty.

## Clarifications for Each Tab

## Entities Tabs

### Users:

- Every record in the **Users** tab must include at least one of the following fields: `user_id`, `username`, or `email`.
- Either `first_name` + `last_name` **or** `full_name` are mandatory for mapping inputs.
  - `full_name` should be a concatenation of `first_name` and `last_name`. 
  All 3 fields are **required** to be populated in the output.
- The `is_active` field should have a value of either **Yes** or **No**.
- The fields `create_at`, `updated_at`, and `last_login_at` must follow a valid datetime format. For example `2023-01-01T12:00:00.00Z`  
  - Convert datetime to ISO 8601
    ```python
    from datetime import datetime

    # Convert the date string to a datetime object
    dt = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")  # Adjust format if needed

    # Convert to ISO 8601 format with UTC (adding 'Z' at the end)
    iso_format = dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    ```

### Groups:

- Every record in the **Groups** tab must include at least one of the following fields: `group_id` or `group_name`.
- If `group_id` is unpopulated, populate with an incrementing number.

### Roles:

- Every record in the **Roles** tab must include at least one of the following fields: `role_id` or `role_name`.
- The `permissions` field should contain values separated by commas.

### Resources:

- Every record in the **Resources** tab must include at least one of the following fields: `resource_id` or `resource_name`.

    - If only `username` was provided, populate `username` under `user_id`.
