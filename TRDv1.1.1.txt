2. Introduction
The AMT-8000 CLI Facelift project aims to modernize the command-line interface of the existing AppMapper tool (AMT-8000) by introducing a retro sci-fi aesthetic, enhancing usability, and improving data presentation. The core functionality of the application remains unchanged; this update targets only the CLI presentation layer to create a more engaging and efficient user experience.
3. Objectives
Apply a retro sci-fi visual theme to the CLI.

Enhance readability with fixed-width fonts, field truncation, and structured layouts.

Improve user interaction through color coding, grouped data headers, and pagination.

Preserve all existing functionality and ensure compatibility with current input/output formats.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Boot Sequence
Display a stylized boot sequence to establish the retro sci-fi theme upon startup.

Include simulated system check messages and a mission statement.

4.2 Scan Phase
Automatically detect and list input files from a user-specified directory.

Show sample data from each sheet or CSV file in a concise, readable format.

Implement pagination to handle large numbers of columns or files efficiently.

4.3 Alignment Phase
Present mapping suggestions in a grid layout with fixed-width columns.

Use color coding to indicate confidence levels and highlight warnings.

Enable interactive editing of mappings within the CLI.

4.4 Transmission Phase
Save the AppMap and output transformed data in the existing specified format.

Offer options to list, download, or delete previous transmissions.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
The CLI must function correctly on standard terminal emulators supporting ANSI escape codes.

Performance must remain consistent with the current implementation, with no significant delays introduced by the facelift.

Code must be well-documented, modular, and adhere to best practices for maintainability.

6. Assumptions
Users’ terminals support ANSI color codes for color output.

Input files conform to the existing AppMapper specifications.

The current AppMapper functionality is stable and requires no modifications beyond the CLI.

7. Proposed Design
Architecture: Updates will be implemented within the existing Python-based CLI module, leveraging standard libraries for text formatting and color output.

File Structure: No changes to the existing file structure; enhancements will be confined to the CLI presentation logic.

Process Flow: Users will navigate a guided sequence—boot, scan, alignment, and transmission—each with clear prompts and interactive options.

8. Development Plan
Phase 1: Develop the boot sequence and establish the CLI framework.

Phase 2: Enhance the scan phase with sample data display and pagination.

Phase 3: Build the alignment phase with a mapping grid and interactive editing.

Phase 4: Refine the transmission phase with updated messages and options.

Phase 5: Conduct testing and finalize based on feedback.

9. Testing Requirements
Ensure readability and alignment across various terminal sizes and font configurations.

Validate that color coding enhances usability without overwhelming the user.

Confirm that all existing functionality operates as expected with the updated CLI.

10. Risks and Mitigation
Risk: Inconsistent color display across terminals.
Mitigation: Include a --no-color flag to disable color output.

Risk: Pagination may frustrate users with extensive data.
Mitigation: Provide options to bypass pagination or adjust page size.

11. Dependencies
Python 3.8 or higher.

Existing AppMapper dependencies (e.g., pandas, fuzzywuzzy, openpyxl).

12. Deliverables
Updated CLI code integrated into the AppMapper repository.

User documentation detailing new CLI features and usage instructions.

Sample input files for testing the enhanced interface.
